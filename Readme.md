# emonTx V3 3-phase Firmware

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openenergymonitor/emontx-3phase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openenergymonitor/emontx-3phase)


**The emonTx V3 has been designed for single-phase AC monitoring, however the emonTx can monitor 'approximate' three-phase (assuming balanced phases) using this firmware. [Further reading](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/electricity-monitoring/ac-power-theory/3-phase-power)**

## [User Guide](emontx-3-phase-userguide.pdf)
