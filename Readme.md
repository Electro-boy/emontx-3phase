# emonTx V3 3-phase Firmware

**The emonTx V3 has been designed for single-phase AC monitoring, however the emonTx can monitor 'approximate' three-phase (assuming balanced phases) using this firmware. [Further reading](https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/buildingblocks/3-phase-power)**

## Required Hardware

- emonTx V3.4
- 3 x Clip on CT sensors
- 1 x AC-AC adapter
- USB to UART programmer (to upload firmware)

## Upload

- Firmware can be uploaded directly using [emonUpload](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonupload) tool

Or

- Firmware can be compiled and uploaded PlatformIO, see [User Guide](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/compiling)

Or

- Arduino IDE
